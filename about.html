    <p>There is a famous saying in the USA: “Nothing is more American than Mom, Baseball, and Apple Pie”, and
        Copenhagen
        finally has its first taste of the real deal. Found in nearly every mom-and-pop diner across the USA, pie is
        deeply
        rooted in America’s cultural DNA.</p>
    <p>In October 2015, The American Pie Company opened its doors as Denmark’s first American pie shop to an
        eagerly
        awaiting
        public of Danish foodies and homesick ex-pats. Co-founders Erin Eberhardt Chapman and Dorte Prip shared
        a
        simple vision,
        and merged their complementary skill sets to set the wheels in motion.
        Erin hails from the farmlands of Illinois and the northwoods of Wisconsin, USA. Homegrown and
        home-cooking
        equaled love,
        and her obsession with food started with growing up on her grandparents’ farms, practicing family
        recipes,
        enjoying the
        abundance of her dad’s vegetable gardens each year, and inheriting her mom’s “baking-to-relax”
        tendencies. 
    </p>
    <p>With over 20 years experience in the advertising industry, Erin has specialized in brand building and
        image
        development
        for lifestyle, food and fashion clientele on both national and international levels. Merging her love
        for
        food and art
        direction, Erin began food styling, cookbook design and recipe development, and has co-authored two
        cookbooks, American
        Pie and American Diner, as well as authoring the pie shop’s own cookbook, The Pie Shop Cookbook and
        Autentisk Amerikansk
        Pie. Having lived in Denmark since 1998, the merging of food and nostalgia has been a constant help to
        ward
        off
        homesickness.</p>
    <p> The women came together to create exactly what they had been missing in Denmark – a home away from home
        –
        making The
        American Pie Company nothing short of an experience. </p>
